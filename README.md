```jsx
import React from "react";
import { View, StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import ReminidersNotifications from "@/components/ReminidersNotifications";

const RemindersScreen = () => (

  },
});

export default RemindersScreen;
```

### Route Configuration

To add this screen to your Expo Router application:

2. Set up the route in your `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` file
3. Configure your tab layout in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` 

## Component Structure

The component consists of:

- **ReminidersNotifications**: Main component that manages time slots and user interactions
- **DarkGradientButton**: Reusable gradient button component with press animation

## Props & Customization

The component accepts the following props:

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| initialTimeSlots | TimeSlot[] | [Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Evening] | Predefined time slots |
| onTimesSelected | Function | undefined | Callback when user confirms selections |
| theme | Object | Light theme | Customization options for colors |

## Technical Details

### Time Slot Management

The component maintains selected time slots in state:

```javascript
const [selectedHours, setSelectedHours] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

Time slots can be toggled by tapping, with visual feedback to indicate selection.

### Custom Time Selection

The component uses a platform-specific approach for time selection:
- On iOS: Custom modal with DateTimePicker in spinner mode
- On Android: Native DateTimePicker dialog

### Animations

The UI includes several animated elements:
- FadeInDown: Title and cards fade in from top
- SlideInRight: Time slots slide in from right with sequential delay
- Layout animations: Smooth transitions when items are added or removed
